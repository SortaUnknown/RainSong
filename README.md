**As of Sept. 22, 2023, with the release of RegionKit 3.11, this mod has been superseded by RegionKit's Rain Song module, and works with Rain World v1.9. From now on forward, that module will continue to be supported. This repo will be kept up as a public archive, and for its potential use as a mod compatible with Rain World v1.5**

This mod allows region makers using CRS to add a special looping sound that plays continuously when the rain is approaching.

To use this mod, add whatever sound you want to use as a Rain Song to your region pack's Song folder as usual, then append "_RAINSONG"
into the file's name, then enable this mod (You must add it as a dependency to your region mod for end users to be able to hear the song as well).

Originally developed as part of the Drowned Pantheon region jam.
