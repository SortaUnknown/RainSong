This mod allows region makers using CRS to add a special looping sound that plays continuously when the rain is approaching.

To use this mod, add whatever sound you want to use as a Rain Song to your region pack's Song folder as usual, then append "_RAINSONG"
into the file's name, then enable this mod (You must add it as a dependency to your region mod for end users to be able to hear the song as well).

Originally developed as part of the Drowned Pantheon region jam.
